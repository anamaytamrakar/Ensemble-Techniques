Improvements pending - 
- Model Building is completed with errors. 
- First I have to create the standard classification algorithm and then choose appropriate algorithms and why that is used. 
- Advantages & disadvantages of the algorithm used in the project. 
- Compare results with the base model. 
- Discussing key parameters available in the selected algorithm and what values I initialized in these parameters.
- What are the regularization techniques used in the model. 
- Will try these codes

    from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier 
    abcl = AdaBoostClassifier( n_estimators= 200, learning_rate=0.1, random_state=22) 
    abcl = abcl.fit(X_train, y_train) 
    pred_AB = abcl.predict(X_test) a
    cc_AB = accuracy_score(y_test, pred_AB) 
    recall_AB = recall_score(y_test, pred_AB, pos_label='yes') 
    tempResultsDf = pd.DataFrame({'Method':['Adaboost'], 'accuracy': [acc_AB], 'recall':[recall_AB]}) 
    resultsDf = pd.concat([resultsDf, tempResultsDf]) 
    resultsDf = resultsDf[['Method', 'accuracy', 'recall']] 
  }
